Hello, my name is Ziqiang Xu. I am currently a second-year Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Robot and Smart System Engineering & AI Convergence Security at Kyungpook National University. I am conducting my research under the supervision of Professor [Bubryur Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/brkimknu/principal-investigator?authuser=0) at the [Physical Artificial Intelligence Applications (PAIA)](https://sites.google.com/view/brkimknu/home?authuser=0) Lab. During my undergraduate studies, I had the great honor of collaborating with and receiving guidance from Professor [Yingliang Zhao](https://5y.nuc.edu.cn/info/1695/12878.htm).

My research interests include artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, image processing, and related fields.

I have completed several projects, including:

1. A Laboratory Management System Based on WeChat Mini Programs  
   â€“ Undergraduate Thesis (2023)

2. GreenViT: A Vision Transformer with Single-Path Progressive Upsampling for Urban Green-Space Segmentation and Auditable Area Estimation
   â€“ Submitted to a journal (2025) 

3. Astronomical Object Recognition Based on Deep Learning  
   â€“ Currently being further developed (2025)  
   The project has been uploaded to GitHub:  
   ðŸ‘‰[PlanetaryImageClassifier](https://github.com/knuxzq/PlanetaryImageClassifier)  
   
   
You can find more detailed information in my [CV](/uploads/resume.pdf).
